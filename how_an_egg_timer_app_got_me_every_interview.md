## This for real? YES

6 interviews, 6 offers!

## The App

- Search "RunnyEgg" in the App Store
- [App Store link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/runnyegg/id1492171626)
- UI is beautiful
- Swipe left or right for different types of egg timers
- Has IAP - In App Purchases (buy me coffee/beer)
- UIKit


## Welcome Tutorial

- SVG animations
- Egg is moving while boiling in water
- has sound

## Why tho?

1. Your app is in the App Store. Employers see you have been through the process. App Store rejection is common.
2. Proof of the minimum work you can do. Employers see what you're capable of.
3. IAP
4. Trial version of you
5. Ice breaker during interview. Easy for you to talk about your app. You know how it works. Also makes you more memorable to employers.

## Marketing?

- None on twitter
- Attached app to CV/Resume
- In CV: Link to app, link to video demo
- Share GitHub? Yes, helpful. Video is what Emin looks at first now that he's involved in hiring.

## I have...

I have
- An egg timer app

VS
- IAP
- lottie animations
- sounds
- background timers
- custom haptics
- local notifications
- remote JSON fetch

## Rdy. Set. Stress

Anticipate questions. Be ready with answers.

- UIKit or SwiftUI?
- Restore purchases?
- How did you solve the scroll?
- Why is background timer tricky? What happens if user closes the app and comes back to it later? What does the timer say?
- How is working with Lottie?
- Did you earn anything from it?

## Be real

It's just a simple app

## SwiftUI vs UIKIt?

- Not in a rush? SwiftUI and Combine
- UIKit is 80% of the apps out there
- Don't bother with Storyboard

## Advice

- Make it easy for employers to check out your app
- No login or registration
- Emin would still show this app to employers today
- It's a simple app, but it's over-engineered
